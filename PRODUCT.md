## Coin Packages (In-App Purchase)

Users buy coins with real money. These are the available packages:

| Price (USD) | Coins | Coins per dollar |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| $2.99 | 16,500 | ~5,519 |
| $5.99 | 33,000 | ~5,509 |
| $9.99 | 55,000 | ~5,505 |
| $29.99 | 165,000 | ~5,502 |
| $59.99 | 330,000 | ~5,501 |
| $99.99 | 550,000 | ~5,501 |

**Ratio is flat** — no meaningful bulk discount. ~5,500 coins per dollar across all tiers.

## Direct Calls (caller → receiver, per minute)

Receiver sets their own rate based on their level. They earn 60% of what the caller pays.

| Tier | Caller pays (coins/min) | Receiver earns (sparks/min) | Platform keeps |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| ≤Lv3 | 2,100 | 1,260 | 840 |
| Lv4  | 3,200 | 1,920 | 1,280 |
| Lv5  | 4,200 | 2,520 | 1,680 |
| Lv6  | 5,400 | 3,240 | 2,160 |
| Lv7  | 6,400 | 3,840 | 2,560 |
| Lv8  | 8,000 | 4,800 | 3,200 |
| Lv9+ | 27,000 | 16,200 | 10,800 |

---

## Random Calls (per minute)

| | Coins/min |
|---|---|
| Caller pays | 600 |
| Receiver earns | 360 (60%) |
| Platform keeps | 240 (40%) |

## Platform Economics (Calls Only — No Gifts)

> Worst-case estimate. Assumes 100% of user spend goes to random calls. Gifts are pure margin on top of this.

**Per $1.00 a user spends — full cost waterfall:**

| Deduction | Amount |
|---|---|
| User pays | $1.00 |
| − Apple / Google store cut (30%) | −$0.30 |
| − Host payout (60% of coins) | −$0.42 |
| **Gross profit** | **$0.28** |
| − Agora random call (~$0.008/min × ~9.2 min) | −$0.074 |
| **Net before fixed costs** | **~$0.206 per $1** |

**Monthly fixed infrastructure costs:**

| Service | Cost/month |
|---|---|
| Apple Developer Account | ~$8.25 |
| Google Play Developer | ~$0 (one-time $25, done) |
| Render API (Standard, no sleep) | $25.00 |
| Render PostgreSQL | $7.00 |
| Render Redis (when added) | $12.00 |
| Firebase (FCM + Auth) | $0.00 (free tier to ~50K MAU) |
| Domain / SSL | ~$1.25 |
| **Total fixed** | **~$53.50/month** |

**Net profit projection (random calls only, no gifts):**

| Monthly gross revenue | Variable net (20.6%) | − Fixed costs | **Monthly net profit** | Effective margin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $500 | $103 | −$53.50 | **$49.50** | 9.9% |
| $1,000 | $206 | −$53.50 | **$152.50** | 15.3% |
| $2,500 | $515 | −$53.50 | **$461.50** | 18.5% |
| $5,000 | $1,030 | −$53.50 | **$976.50** | 19.5% |
| $10,000 | $2,060 | −$53.50 | **$2,006.50** | 20.1% |

**Floor is ~20% net margin** at scale on calls alone. Gifts push this toward 28%.  
Calls are the volume driver. Gifts are the profit driver.

## Video Infrastructure: Agora

Chosen for its proprietary UDP protocol that bypasses Gulf region (UAE, Saudi) WebRTC filtering — a hard requirement for our target market. Single SDK covers both calls and live streaming.

**Agora live streaming cost breakdown:**

| Scenario | Host | Viewers | Duration | Agora cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small stream | 1 | 10 | 1hr | ~$0.72 |
| Medium stream | 1 | 50 | 1hr | ~$3.12 |
| Large stream | 1 | 200 | 1hr | ~$11.52 |

> Live streaming audience is naturally self-limiting: users in a random call cannot simultaneously watch a live stream. Random calls pull users out of passive watching into active (paying) calls. Live works as a discovery surface → direct call conversion funnel, keeping viewer counts low and Agora live costs manageable.

**Live stream viewer cap (by host level):**

| Host Level | Max Viewers | Agora cost (1hr, no gifts) |
|---|---|---|
| ≤Lv3 | 20 | ~$1.32 |
| Lv4–Lv5 | 50 | ~$3.12 |
| Lv6–Lv8 | 100 | ~$5.92 |
| Lv9+ | 200 | ~$11.52 |

Caps serve two purposes: protect the platform from costly zero-gift streams at low levels, and incentivise hosts to level up (more viewers = more gift potential = more earning). In practice, viewer counts stay low anyway — the random call algorithm continuously pulls viewers out of live streams into paid calls.

## Random Call Strategy

Random calls are priced cheap intentionally (600 coins/min = ~$0.11/min to caller). The goal is volume, not margin per call.

**Why random calls win at scale:**
- Low barrier to tap → high frequency of use
- Caller is always paying — no passive free-riders like live
- 1,000 users × 30 min/day = 30,000 call-minutes/day = **~$6,180/month net profit** (before gifts)
- Margin is thin per call (~20%) but volume makes it the biggest revenue line

**Random call as a hook:**
- Caller meets someone interesting → wants to call them again → books a direct call (higher rate)
- Direct call rates are 3.5× to 45× higher than random → upsell path
- Random call is the entry drug; direct call and gifts are the monetisation

**Live → Random → Direct call funnel:**
1. User watches a live stream (free, no cost to them)
2. Taps random call → starts paying 600 coins/min
3. Likes the person → books direct call (Lv6 = 5,400 coins/min)
4. During calls, sends gifts → highest margin feature

## Call Types & Mechanics

### Random Call

| State | Coins | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Searching | 0 | Algorithm finds match (priority: live hosts → idle users) |
| Connected | 600/min | Both parties in call, coins tick |
| Next tapped | 0 | Coins stop instantly, screen blurs, new match search begins |
| New match found | 600/min | Coins resume |
| Call ended | 0 | Call over, coins stop |

- Both parties opt in implicitly — no accept/decline screen
- If matched person is live: their stream **pauses**, status → **busy**
- When random call ends: stream stays paused — host must manually resume (safety)
- "Next" is free — no coins charged during transition between randoms

### Direct Call (paid, receiver sets rate)

- Caller initiates from a profile
- Receiver gets an incoming call screen — they can **accept** or **decline**
- If declined: caller is not charged for that minute
- Rate is set by receiver based on their level (2,100 → 27,000 coins/min)
- Receiver earns 60% of the rate they set
