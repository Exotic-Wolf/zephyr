## Product Vision

- **Goal:** build a flawless, top-tier, Steve Jobs-level Chamet/Olamet-style social video app.
- **Primary mobile audience:** iPhone users first, with Android parity through Flutter.
- **Stack choice:** Flutter is intentional because one product-quality codebase can serve iOS and Android while keeping interaction, animation, and realtime behavior consistent.
- **Target market:** Arab Gulf users calling Philippines/Asia hosts.
- **Core revenue:** coin-based gifts + direct/random video calls + live streaming.
- **Original bonus idea:** premium live / premium room flow where hosts can start premium directly or upgrade free live into a paid-per-minute room.
- **Execution style:** build robust reusable cells first, then compose flawless modules and product organs.

## Operating Rule

Every meaningful work slice must update this file before commit/push:

- Update **Current TODO Tracker** with what changed, what is next, and what is blocked.
- Update **Audit Log** when a feature/module quality grade changes.
- Remove or rewrite stale product claims as soon as implementation makes them outdated.
- Preserve one source of truth per domain; do not add parallel truth systems for convenience.
- Keep iPhone user experience as the primary polish bar, while preserving Flutter Android parity.

| P0 | Done | Codex | Fix direct-call `API 400` user experience | Mobile now parses backend error envelopes into product messages; Firebase `onPresenceChanged` now mirrors RTDB create/update/delete writes into Postgres availability and was deployed on 6 Jun 2026 |
| P0 | Action required | User | Retest direct call with two online accounts | Open/log in both accounts after the Functions deploy so each account rewrites presence, then call only when the receiver badge is online/live and not busy |
| P0 | Done | Codex | Fix random-call receiver signaling lifecycle | Home now consumes backend `event=matched`, shows a host earning ribbon, routes accepted calls into Agora random mode, cleanly declines/timeouts, and Cloud Function cleanup no longer ends matched random sessions before join |
| P0 | Action required | User | Manual two-account random-call smoke test | Use one customer and one host/girl account to verify live-host priority, receiver ribbon, accept, decline, timeout, end, and next-call behavior on simulator/device |
| P0 | Done | Codex | Make wallet and session ledger writes transactional | Call ticks, direct/random call gifts, live gifts, dev coin credit, IAP credit, and IAP refunds now use PostgreSQL transactions/row locks where needed |
| P0 | Done | Codex | Add ledger idempotency keys and real Postgres race tests | Call ticks, call gifts, and live-room gifts now accept `X-Idempotency-Key`; mobile sends stable paid-action keys; `pnpm --filter zephyr-api test:db:race` passed 3/3 against local Postgres on 6 Jun 2026 |
| P0 | Done | Codex | Fix Google Play IAP verification contract | Android now sends the Play purchase token as canonical transaction ID, consumes coin packs after backend credit, backend defaults match real app IDs, and Google RTDN refunds resolve by purchase token |
| P0 | Done | User | Set production IAP env on Render | `GOOGLE_PLAY_PACKAGE_NAME`, `APPLE_BUNDLE_ID`, Google Play service-account key, and existing `NODE_ENV=production` were confirmed by the user on 6 Jun 2026 |
| P0 | Done | Codex | Promote Google Play IAP hardening to `main` | PR #5 merged `dev` into `main` on 6 Jun 2026; Render readiness endpoint returned `ok` with Postgres storage after merge |
| P0 | Done | Codex | Generate Android IAP smoke AAB `1.0.5+6` | Built signed release bundle at `apps/zephyr-mobile/build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab` after the purchase-token fix; generated manifest verifies package `com.zephyr.zephyr_mobile`, version name `1.0.5`, version code `6` |
| P0 | Done | User | Upload Android IAP smoke AAB `1.0.5+6` to internal testing | User confirmed the fresh AAB was uploaded and published on 6 Jun 2026; earlier `1.0.4+5` does not contain the mobile purchase-token/consume fix |
| P0 | Pending review | Google | Google Play merchant/bank verification | User submitted the Play payments profile and SBM bank statement on 7 Jun 2026; one-time product creation and catalog visibility are blocked until Google completes or accepts verification |
| P0 | Blocked | User | Manual Google Play internal-test purchase smoke | Current tester build shows "Purchases are temporarily unavailable" because no matching Play one-time products exist/are visible yet; after merchant verification, create/publish `pack_299`, wait for catalog propagation, then retry backend credit/consume/refund smoke |
| P0 | Audit finding | Codex | Replace stale Flutter widget test harness | `flutter test` currently pumps Firebase-backed `MyApp` without Firebase init and still expects removed guest onboarding copy |
| P0 | Next | Codex | Wire RTDB rules suite into normal check/CI path | Prevents future rules drift from silently weakening ownership/security |
| P1 | Audit finding | Codex | Wire follow/profile/feed host model end-to-end | Profile follow is local-only, following list parsing is wrong, and live feed should filter canonical host accounts |
| P1 | Audit finding | Codex | Unify block/report ownership | Thread chat uses Firestore block/report state while profile uses backend `user_blocks`; product should have one moderation truth |
| P1 | Audit finding | Codex | Refresh stale contracts and instructions | OpenAPI and Copilot instructions still describe old guest/status behavior and do not match the current canonical availability architecture |
| P1 | Planned | Codex | Implement premium live lifecycle | Free live -> premium, start premium directly, paid entry, per-minute billing, lock screen, cleanup |
| P1 | Planned | Codex | Add `PremiumLiveRealtime` module once lifecycle exists | Keeps premium live non-interruptible and owned by a dedicated realtime module |
| P1 | Planned | Codex | Replace live audience counter with per-viewer presence/count derivation | Prevents inaccurate counts from duplicate joins/disconnect edge cases |
| P2 | Planned | Codex | Move trusted gift event fan-out toward backend/Admin SDK confirmation | Prevents spoofed gift display events while keeping gift economy reusable |

Immediate next work:

1. Manually smoke test random call with two accounts: customer seeks, host sees ribbon, host accepts, host declines, host timeout, customer next, both end.
2. Wait for Google Play merchant/bank verification, create/publish `pack_299`, then smoke one purchase from the published `1.0.5+6` internal testing build.
3. Replace stale Flutter widget tests with Firebase-mocked or dependency-injected tests that match current onboarding.
4. Add RTDB rules suite and DB race suite to the default local/CI check path.
5. Retest direct call with two online accounts after the deployed presence-sync trigger.
6. Implement premium live lifecycle and `PremiumLiveRealtime`.
7. Move trusted gift fan-out behind backend/Admin SDK confirmation.

## Security Defaults (Backend)

- Global DTO validation (`whitelist`, `forbidNonWhitelisted`)
- Global rate limiting (120 requests / 60s per IP)
- Unified JSON error envelope on all failures
- Google token verified server-side with audience check
- Apple token verified via JWKS
- IAP receipts verified cryptographically (Apple JWS + Google Publisher API)

## Deploy Checklist (Render)

**Target:** Render Web Service + managed Postgres. Blueprint: `render.yaml` at repo root.

**Pre-deploy:**

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter zephyr-api test
pnpm --filter zephyr-api build
```

**Render setup:**

1. Push branch to GitHub
2. Create Blueprint from repo — Render detects `render.yaml`, creates `zephyr-api`
3. Set secret env values: `JWT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL` (internal URL), `CORS_ORIGINS`, `AGORA_APP_ID`, `AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS`, `APPLE_CLIENT_ID`
4. Trigger deploy

**Start command** (already in blueprint): `pnpm --filter zephyr-api start:prod`

**Post-deploy smoke test:**

```bash
cd services/zephyr-api
BASE_URL=https://your-api-domain.com node scripts/smoke.mjs
```

**Rollback:** Keep previous deployment available. If smoke fails, roll back immediately. Confirm `/v1/auth/google-login` and `/v1/rooms` before reopening traffic.

**Mobile switch:** `flutter run --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-domain.com`

**Security baseline:**
- Strong random `JWT_SECRET` (32+ chars)
- `CORS_ORIGINS` strict — never `*`
- Service visibility private to repo/team
- Rotate secrets if exposed

## Architecture Decisions (Locked)

- **Firebase Chat** — Firestore for messages/conversations, RTDB for real-time presence (onDisconnect), Storage for image uploads. Backend generates custom Firebase tokens.
- **Firebase RTDB is the single source of truth for real-time availability** — `presence/{userId}` is not a single overloaded status string. It is the canonical availability cell for connection, activity, routing eligibility, display status, and call/live context. RTDB's `onDisconnect` guarantees cleanup even on app kill/crash. All clients listen to RTDB for user availability before initiating calls, routing random calls, or showing status badges.
- **Firebase Cloud Functions (asia-southeast1)** — 3 deployed functions provide server-side safety nets:
  - `onCallSignalDeleted`: RTDB trigger on `direct_calls/{userId}` deletion → ends Postgres call session via internal API
  - `onPresenceChanged`: RTDB trigger on `presence/{userId}` update → syncs the canonical display/availability/routing projection to Postgres, and ends the room when `displayStatus` leaves `live`
  - `reapStalePresence`: Scheduled every 5 min → scans all presence nodes, resets stale entries (>5min) to the canonical offline payload, ends orphaned live rooms
  - Internal endpoints: `POST /v1/internal/end-call-session`, `POST /v1/internal/end-room` (validated via `X-Service-Key` header)
- **Agora RTC** — replaces LiveKit for ALL video (calls + live streaming). Proprietary UDP bypasses Gulf WebRTC filtering. Single SDK, smaller APK.
- **Zero Socket.IO** — All real-time is Firebase RTDB. Live room comments/reactions/audience state use RTDB; trusted room status and gift events must be backend-confirmed before fan-out. Random call matchmaking uses REST + RTDB signals. No WebSocket libraries exist in the codebase.
- **FCM/APNs** — push notifications for chat messages (backend relays via `POST /v1/messages/push`)
- **Firebase is truth** — Firestore is source of truth for messages/conversations. RTDB is source of truth for realtime availability, call/live signaling, visible live events, and user identity (`profiles/{userId}` — displayName, avatarUrl, countryCode, language, birthday). Backend validates economy and issues tokens.

---

## Canonical Realtime Availability Model

This section is product law for the realtime cell. The goal is not just "show a badge"; the goal is to make inbox, direct call, random call, live, Agora, and backend matchmaking read the same authoritative availability truth.

### Source-of-truth boundaries

| Domain | Canonical owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Inbox/messages | Firestore | Message bodies, conversation metadata, read/delivered state |
| Display identity | RTDB `profiles/{userId}` | displayName, avatarUrl, countryCode, language, birthday |
| Realtime availability | RTDB `presence/{userId}` | Connection, current activity, routing eligibility, display status |
| Media session | Agora | Audio/video transport only; Agora events may trigger presence intents, but Agora does not own availability |
| Money/session ledger | Postgres | Wallets, call sessions, gifts, IAP, revenue, reports |
| Gifts | Backend + reusable gift module | Same gift catalog/animation/economy pipeline reused in inbox, live, premium live, direct call, and random call |

### Presence cell shape

`presence/{userId}` is a canonical state cell. It should be written only through the realtime availability module, never by feature screens with raw status strings.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "connection": "online",
  "activity": "idle",
  "availability": "available",
  "routing": {
    "directCall": true,
    "randomCall": true
  },
  "displayStatus": "online",
  "interruptible": true,
  "roomId": null,
  "roomMode": null,
  "callSessionId": null,
  "premiumRoomSessionId": null,
  "previousActivity": null,
  "previousRoomId": null,
  "state": "online",
  "updatedAt": 1234567890
}
```

Allowed values:

| Field | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `connection` | `online`, `offline` | RTDB reachability. Owned by connect/onDisconnect/reaper logic. |
| `activity` | `idle`, `away`, `free_live_host`, `free_live_viewer`, `premium_live_host`, `premium_live_viewer`, `live_paused`, `direct_call`, `random_call` | What the user is doing. Owned by intent methods such as `startLive`, `upgradeLiveToPremium`, `enterRandomCall`, `finishCall`. |
| `availability` | `available`, `busy`, `unavailable` | Coarse product availability. Matchmaking must never infer this from display text. |
| `routing.directCall` | boolean | Whether explicit paid direct call may route to this user. |
| `routing.randomCall` | boolean | Whether automatic random matchmaking may select this user. |
| `displayStatus` | `online`, `away`, `live`, `premium_live`, `busy`, `offline` | UI badge only. It is derived from canonical state, not used as algorithm truth. |
| `interruptible` | boolean | Whether a higher-value flow may pause the current activity. Free live can be interruptible; premium live and calls are not. |
| `roomId` | string/null | Present only for active or paused live/premium live context. |
| `roomMode` | `free_live`, `premium_live`, null | Current room monetization mode. |
| `callSessionId` | string/null | Present only during direct/random call. |
| `premiumRoomSessionId` | string/null | Present only during metered premium live participation. |
| `previousActivity`, `previousRoomId` | string/null | Used for live -> random/direct transitions and safe resume/end decisions. |
| `state` | same as `displayStatus` | Temporary legacy compatibility field. New code must read/write canonical fields first. |
| `updatedAt` | server timestamp | Last canonical state write. |

### Backend projection

Postgres stores only a queryable projection of RTDB presence. RTDB remains source of truth.

| Postgres field | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `users.status` | `displayStatus` | Legacy/UI display fallback |
| `users.presence_connection` | `connection` | Offline/freshness projection |
| `users.presence_activity` | `activity` | Current canonical activity |
| `users.presence_availability` | `availability` | Backend availability guard |
| `users.can_direct_call` | `routing.directCall` | Direct-call API routeability |
| `users.can_random_call` | `routing.randomCall` | Random-call matchmaking routeability |
| `users.presence_updated_at` | `updatedAt` | Last canonical RTDB write mirrored to Postgres |

Backend matching and call creation must use `presence_availability`, `can_direct_call`, and `can_random_call`; they must not infer routeability from `users.status` or UI badge text.

### Canonical transitions

| Intent | Resulting state |
|---|---|
| App foreground and idle | `connection=online`, `activity=idle`, `availability=available`, `routing.directCall=true`, `routing.randomCall=true`, `displayStatus=online` |
| App idle/away | `connection=online`, `activity=away`, `availability=available`, `routing.directCall=true`, `routing.randomCall=false`, `displayStatus=away` |
| Start free live as host | `connection=online`, `activity=free_live_host`, `availability=available`, `routing.directCall=true`, `routing.randomCall=true`, `interruptible=true`, `displayStatus=live`, `roomId=<roomId>`, `roomMode=free_live` |
| Join free live as viewer | `connection=online`, `activity=free_live_viewer`, `availability=available`, `routing.directCall=true`, `routing.randomCall=true`, `interruptible=true`, `displayStatus=online`, `roomId=<roomId>`, `roomMode=free_live` |
| Upgrade free live to premium live | Host presses the premium action; backend creates premium room pricing/session; current viewers see a locked screen with entry gift/payment CTA |
| Enter premium live as host | `connection=online`, `activity=premium_live_host`, `availability=busy`, `routing.directCall=false`, `routing.randomCall=false`, `interruptible=false`, `displayStatus=premium_live`, `roomId=<roomId>`, `roomMode=premium_live` |
| Enter premium live as viewer | `connection=online`, `activity=premium_live_viewer`, `availability=busy`, `routing.directCall=false`, `routing.randomCall=false`, `interruptible=false`, `displayStatus=busy`, `roomId=<roomId>`, `roomMode=premium_live`, `premiumRoomSessionId=<sessionId>` |
| Enter direct call | `connection=online`, `activity=direct_call`, `availability=busy`, `routing.directCall=false`, `routing.randomCall=false`, `interruptible=false`, `displayStatus=busy`, `callSessionId=<sessionId>` |
| Enter random call | `connection=online`, `activity=random_call`, `availability=busy`, `routing.directCall=false`, `routing.randomCall=false`, `interruptible=false`, `displayStatus=busy`, `callSessionId=<sessionId>` |
| Free live host pulled into random/direct call | Store `previousActivity=free_live_host` and `previousRoomId=<roomId>`, pause the free live room, then enter call state |
| Premium live host receives call/random route | No transition. Premium live is non-interruptible; routing must skip the host. |
| Call ends after live was paused | `connection=online`, `activity=live_paused`, `availability=unavailable`, `routing.directCall=false`, `routing.randomCall=false`, `displayStatus=busy`, `roomId=<previousRoomId>` until host explicitly resumes or ends live |
| Resume paused free live | Return to the Start free live state |
| End live | Clear `roomId`, return to idle/away based on foreground activity |
| App disconnect/crash | `connection=offline`, `activity=idle`, `availability=unavailable`, `routing.directCall=false`, `routing.randomCall=false`, `displayStatus=offline`; cleanup functions end affected call/live sessions |

### Module ownership target

Feature screens should express intent, not RTDB protocol details.

Target modules/classes:

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `PresenceRealtime` | `presence/{userId}` fields, transitions, onDisconnect, local cache, status badge derivation |
| `ProfilesRealtime` | `profiles/{userId}` reads/writes and profile cache |
| `DirectCallSignals` | Direct-call signaling schema, accept/decline/cancel/timeout cleanup |
| `RandomCallSignals` | Random match signaling schema, partner-left/next/end events |
| `LiveRoomRealtime` | Free live comments/reactions/audience reads; trusted room status should move toward backend/Admin SDK writes |
| `PremiumLiveRealtime` | Premium live lock/unlock state, premium audience presence, room mode changes, and non-interruptible realtime state |
| `GiftModule` | Reusable gift catalog, animation rendering, backend economy confirmation, and post-confirm RTDB/Firestore event fan-out |

Screens should call methods like `presence.enterRandomCall(sessionId)`, `presence.startLive(roomId)`, `presence.finishCall()`, and `directSignals.acceptCall(sessionId)`. Screens must not write raw `busy`, `live`, `offline`, `direct_calls/$id/status`, or `live_rooms/$id/status` values directly.

RTDB rules and emulator tests must enforce the same ownership model: users can write only their own presence/profile, cannot overwrite another user's call signal, cannot end another host's room, and cannot publish trusted gift/status events without backend validation.

## Content & Store Compliance Rules

Zephyr is an 18+ social video product. Adult age rating is a gate, not a permission slip for unmoderated sexual content.

Product law:

- App Store / Play Store listing, screenshots, onboarding, public feeds, normal live, and premium live must not promote nudity, pornographic content, prostitution, or explicitly sexual services.
- Normal live has a no-nudity rule.
- Premium live is paid access to a more intimate group experience, but still must follow platform rules, reporting, blocking, moderation, and host enforcement.
- Direct/random calls are private adult interactions between consenting adults, but the app must still provide report, block, ban, and safety tooling.
- User-generated content surfaces must include terms acceptance, report, block, moderation response, and a clear abuse channel before production launch.
- Gifts are never "maybe." Gifts are a reusable monetization primitive across inbox, normal live, premium live, direct calls, and random calls.

## Coin Packages (In-App Purchase)

Users buy coins with real money. These are the available packages:

| Price (USD) | Coins | Coins per dollar |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|
| $2.99 | 16,500 | ~5,519 |
| $5.99 | 33,000 | ~5,509 |
| $9.99 | 55,000 | ~5,505 |
| $29.99 | 165,000 | ~5,502 |
| $59.99 | 330,000 | ~5,501 |
| $99.99 | 550,000 | ~5,501 |

**Ratio is flat** — no meaningful bulk discount. ~5,500 coins per dollar across all tiers.

---

## Direct Calls (caller → receiver, per minute)

Receiver sets their own rate based on their level. They earn 60% of what the caller pays.

These are product default rate options. Backend config/database owns the active options; mobile renders the options returned by API.

| Tier | Caller pays (coins/min) | Receiver earns (sparks/min) | Platform keeps |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------|----------------|
| ≤Lv3 | 2,100 | 1,260 | 840 |
| Lv4  | 3,200 | 1,920 | 1,280 |
| Lv5  | 4,200 | 2,520 | 1,680 |
| Lv6  | 5,400 | 3,240 | 2,160 |
| Lv7  | 6,400 | 3,840 | 2,560 |
| Lv8  | 8,000 | 4,800 | 3,200 |
| Lv9+ | 27,000 | 16,200 | 10,800 |

---

## Random Calls (per minute)

| | Coins/min |
|---|---|
| Caller pays | 600 |
| Receiver earns | 360 (60%) |
| Platform keeps | 240 (40%) |

These are product defaults. Backend config owns the active random-call rate and split.

---

## Reusable Gift Module

Gifts are a first-class reusable monetization primitive, not a live-only feature.

| Surface | Gift behavior |
|---|---|
| Inbox | Send a gift from a DM thread; message timeline shows the gift event |
| Normal live | Viewers send gifts during free live |
| Premium live | Viewers can pay the entry gift/sticker and continue sending gifts inside |
| Direct call | Caller can send gifts during paid 1:1 call |
| Random call | Caller can send gifts during paid random call |

Gift rules:

- One gift catalog and one animation renderer are reused across all surfaces.
- Backend validates balance, deducts coins, records the ledger transaction, credits host sparks/revenue, then emits/permits the visible gift event.
- Gift events are visible UX; wallet/revenue truth is always Postgres.
- Default split: host receives 60% value in sparks/revenue, platform keeps 40% before infrastructure and store economics are modeled.
- Gift assets are CDN-hosted Lottie/SVGA/animation payloads; 0 heavy gift animations ship in the app bundle.

---

## Premium Live Rooms (paid group live)

Premium live is Zephyr's original monetized group mode: a host can convert a normal free live into a paid room.

| Mode | Many viewers? | Paid per minute? | Gifts? | Interruptible by direct/random call? |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Normal live | yes | no | yes | yes |
| Premium live | yes | yes | yes | no |
| Random call | no | yes | yes | no |
| Direct call | no | yes | yes | no |

Premium live mechanics:

- Host starts a normal live first.
- Host can press an upgrade action to transition the room into premium live.
- Existing viewers see the stream locked and must send/pay an entry gift, such as a 200-coin car sticker, to enter.
- After entry, viewers are billed per minute while inside, for example 600 coins/min.
- Premium live entry fee and per-minute rate are set by the host within level-based limits.
- All premium live limits are backend-configured variables, not client hardcodes.
- Host earns a percentage of entry gifts, per-minute premium live billing, and gifts sent inside the room.
- Premium live is non-interruptible: direct call and random-call routing must skip the host while premium live is active.
- If a viewer balance is insufficient, backend ends that viewer's premium room session and the UI returns to the locked state or exits.
- RTDB owns realtime lock/unlock/audience/comment/reaction display; Postgres owns paid room sessions, billing ticks, entry payments, and revenue.

Premium live is not a replacement for direct/random calls. It fills the gap between free discovery live and private 1:1 monetization: many customers can pay modestly at the same time, while the host gets a stable earning mode.

---

## Leveling & Limits

Zephyr has two separate level systems. Do not mix them.

| Track | Who | Measures | Unlocks |
|---|---|---|---|
| Host Level | Hosts/creators | earning quality, completed paid minutes, gifts received, retention, trust, low reports | direct-call rate options, premium live pricing limits, premium viewer caps, discovery priority |
| Customer VIP Level | Customers/spenders | purchases, gifts sent, paid minutes, loyalty, account trust | profile frames, gift perks, coupons, support priority, cosmetic status |

The inspiration from apps like Tango is the shape, not the exact economy: loyalty/VIP systems reward purchases, gifts, and recurring monthly status, while creator levels should reflect earning power and platform trust. Zephyr's originality is that host earning level and customer VIP level are separate canonical tracks.

### Host Level

Host Level is the creator's earning/trust level. It should be earned by useful activity, not just account age.

Host XP inputs:

- Cleared sparks/revenue earned from direct calls, random calls, premium live, and gifts.
- Completed paid minutes with low dispute/report rate.
- Gifts received from unique customers.
- Free-live to paid conversion quality.
- Repeat customer/follower retention.
- Active hosting days.
- Manual verification and moderation trust.

Host XP exclusions/penalties:

- Refunded, charged back, or fraud-flagged purchases do not count.
- Sessions later marked abusive, fake, or policy-violating can remove XP.
- High report rate, bans, chargeback clusters, or moderation strikes can freeze level progression or demote caps.

Host Level controls configurable limits:

| Config key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `canStartPremiumLiveDirectly` | Whether host can open premium live without first starting free live |
| `premiumEntryGiftCoinMin` / `premiumEntryGiftCoinMax` | Allowed entry gift/sticker range |
| `premiumRateCoinsPerMinuteMin` / `premiumRateCoinsPerMinuteMax` | Allowed premium live per-minute range |
| `premiumViewerCap` | Max paying viewers in premium live |
| `freeLiveViewerCap` | Max viewers in normal live |
| `directCallRateOptions` | Direct-call rate choices available to host |
| `randomMatchWeight` | Discovery/matchmaking boost for trusted high-level hosts |

Suggested policy:

- Early hosts can start free live and upgrade to premium live only after minimum room activity.
- Trusted mid-level hosts can start premium live directly with conservative limits.
- High-level verified hosts get higher entry/rate/viewer caps and stronger discovery.
- All limits live in backend config/database tables. Mobile reads allowed options from API and never hardcodes pricing.

### Customer VIP Level

Customer VIP Level is spender loyalty plus account trust. It should make customers feel recognized without letting them bypass safety rules.

VIP XP inputs:

- Settled in-app purchases.
- Gifts sent across inbox, live, premium live, direct calls, and random calls.
- Paid minutes consumed in direct/random/premium live.
- Recurring monthly activity.

VIP XP exclusions/penalties:

- Refunded or charged-back purchases remove VIP progress.
- Fraud, abusive behavior, or moderation actions can freeze VIP perks.
- VIP level never bypasses report/block/moderation systems.

VIP Level controls configurable perks:

| Config key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `profileFrame` | Cosmetic frame/badge |
| `chatBadge` | Visible badge in inbox/live comments |
| `monthlyCoupons` | Optional coin/gift purchase coupon count |
| `freeGiftAllowance` | Optional reusable gift allowance |
| `supportPriority` | Support priority tier |
| `premiumRoomPerks` | Optional cosmetic/queue perks, never free unauthorized entry |

Suggested policy:

- Maintain both `rolling30dVipLevel` and `lifetimeVipRank`.
- Rolling VIP creates monthly motivation; lifetime rank preserves prestige.
- VIP progress is backend-calculated from cleared ledger data.
- VIP perks are configurable and can be A/B tested without client releases.

### Level Config Contract

Level rules are product variables. Store them server-side and expose them through API.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "hostLevels": [
    {
      "level": 1,
      "canStartPremiumLiveDirectly": false,
      "premiumEntryGiftCoinMin": 0,
      "premiumEntryGiftCoinMax": 0,
      "premiumRateCoinsPerMinuteMin": 0,
      "premiumRateCoinsPerMinuteMax": 0,
      "premiumViewerCap": 0,
      "freeLiveViewerCap": 0,
      "directCallRateOptions": [],
      "randomMatchWeight": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "customerVipLevels": [
    {
      "level": 1,
      "rolling30dXpRequired": 0,
      "lifetimeXpRequired": 0,

        "supportPriority": "standard"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Platform Economics (Calls Only — No Gifts)

> Worst-case estimate. Assumes 100% of user spend goes to random calls. Gifts are pure margin on top of this.

**Per $1.00 a user spends — full cost waterfall:**

| Deduction | Amount |
|---|---|
| User pays | $1.00 |
| − Apple / Google store cut (30%) | −$0.30 |
| − Host payout (60% of coins) | −$0.42 |
| **Gross profit** | **$0.28** |
| − Agora random call (~$0.008/min × ~9.2 min) | −$0.074 |
| **Net before fixed costs** | **~$0.206 per $1** |

**Monthly fixed infrastructure costs:**

| Service | Cost/month |
|---|---|
| Apple Developer Account | ~$8.25 |
| Google Play Developer | ~$0 (one-time $25, done) |
| Render API (Standard, no sleep) | $25.00 |
| Render PostgreSQL | $7.00 |
| Render Redis (when added) | $12.00 |
| Firebase (FCM + Auth) | $0.00 (free tier to ~50K MAU) |
| Domain / SSL | ~$1.25 |
| **Total fixed** | **~$53.50/month** |

**Net profit projection (random calls only, no gifts):**

| Monthly gross revenue | Variable net (20.6%) | − Fixed costs | **Monthly net profit** | Effective margin |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| $500 | $103 | −$53.50 | **$49.50** | 9.9% |
| $1,000 | $206 | −$53.50 | **$152.50** | 15.3% |
| $2,500 | $515 | −$53.50 | **$461.50** | 18.5% |
| $5,000 | $1,030 | −$53.50 | **$976.50** | 19.5% |
| $10,000 | $2,060 | −$53.50 | **$2,006.50** | 20.1% |

**Floor is ~20% net margin** at scale on calls alone. Gifts push this toward 28%.  
Calls are the volume driver. Gifts are the profit driver.

## Video Infrastructure: Agora

Chosen for its proprietary UDP protocol that bypasses Gulf region (UAE, Saudi) WebRTC filtering — a hard requirement for our target market. Single SDK covers both calls and live streaming.

**Agora live streaming cost breakdown:**

| Scenario | Host | Viewers | Duration | Agora cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small stream | 1 | 10 | 1hr | ~$0.72 |
| Medium stream | 1 | 50 | 1hr | ~$3.12 |
| Large stream | 1 | 200 | 1hr | ~$11.52 |

> Free live audience is naturally self-limiting: users in a random call cannot simultaneously watch a free live stream. Random calls pull users out of passive watching into active paid calls. Premium live is different: it is already paid and non-interruptible.

**Live stream viewer cap (by host level):**

These are product default caps. Backend config/database owns the active values; mobile must not hardcode them.

| Host Level | Max Viewers | Agora cost (1hr, no gifts) |
|---|---|---|
| ≤Lv3 | 20 | ~$1.32 |
| Lv4–Lv5 | 50 | ~$3.12 |
| Lv6–Lv8 | 100 | ~$5.92 |
| Lv9+ | 200 | ~$11.52 |

Caps serve two purposes: protect the platform from costly zero-gift streams at low levels, and incentivise hosts to level up (more viewers = more gift potential = more earning). In practice, free-live viewer counts stay lower because random calls can pull users into paid calls; premium live uses paid entry/per-minute billing instead.

---

## Random Call Strategy

Random calls are priced cheap intentionally (600 coins/min = ~$0.11/min to caller). The goal is volume, not margin per call.

**Why random calls win at scale:**
- Low barrier to tap → high frequency of use
- Caller is always paying — no passive free-riders like live
- 1,000 users × 30 min/day = 30,000 call-minutes/day = **~$6,180/month net profit** (before gifts)
- Margin is thin per call (~20%) but volume makes it the biggest revenue line

**Random call as a hook:**
- Caller meets someone interesting → wants to call them again → books a direct call (higher rate)
- Direct call rates are 3.5× to 45× higher than random → upsell path
- Random call is the entry drug; direct call and gifts are the monetisation

**Free Live → Random / Premium Live → Direct Call funnel:**
1. User watches a live stream (free, no cost to them)
2. User taps random call, or host upgrades the room to premium live
3. User pays 600 coins/min in random or premium live
4. User likes the host → books direct call (Lv6 = 5,400 coins/min)
5. During inbox/live/premium/calls, user sends gifts → highest margin reusable feature

---

## Call Types & Mechanics

### Random Call

| State | Coins | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Searching | 0 | Algorithm finds match (priority: interruptible free-live hosts → idle hosts/users) |
| Connected | 600/min | Both parties in call, coins tick |
| Next tapped | 0 | Coins stop instantly, screen blurs, new match search begins |
| New match found | 600/min | Coins resume |
| Call ended | 0 | Call over, coins stop |

- Both parties opt in implicitly — no accept/decline screen
- If matched host is in free live: their stream **pauses**, status → **busy**
- If host is in premium live: skip; premium live is non-interruptible
- When random call ends: stream stays paused — host must manually resume (safety)
- "Next" is free — no coins charged during transition between randoms

### Direct Call (paid, receiver sets rate)

- Caller initiates from receiver's `ProfilePage` → writes to Firebase RTDB at `/direct_calls/{receiverUserId}`
- RTDB payload: `callerId`, `callerName`, `callerAvatarUrl`, `sessionId`, `status`, `ts`
- Receiver's `HomeScreen` listens on that RTDB path → shows `IncomingCallOverlay` (accept/decline)
- On accept: both navigate to `DirectCallScreen` (Agora video), backend `startCallSession` begins billing
- On decline: caller is not charged, RTDB node cleaned up
- Rate is set by receiver based on their level (2,100 → 27,000 coins/min)
- Receiver earns 60% of the rate they set
- Camera-off detection: `onRemoteVideoStateChanged` with reason-based muting (not state-based) to avoid false positives on camera flip

---

## Screens & UI

### Onboarding (`features/onboarding/`)

Two screens, one flow:

**1. Login — `onboarding_page.dart`**
- Dark background (`#150805`) with mascot branding (60% of screen)
- Apple Sign-In button (iOS only, shown first) + Google Sign-In button
- No guest login — real identity required
- API offline warning banner (checks `/health/live` on init)
- Buttons disabled during loading, error text below
- Legal links at bottom: Terms of Service + Privacy Policy (opens in browser)
- On success: checks `user.onboardedAt` — if null → profile setup, else → home

**2. Profile Setup — `profile_setup_screen.dart`**
- 2-page horizontal PageView (no swipe — programmatic navigation only)
- **Page 1 — Gender:** "I am" heading, two large gradient cards (Male / Female). Tap auto-advances after 300ms
- **Page 2 — Language:** Grid of 12 languages (EN, AR, PT, ES, FIL, HI, ID, TH, VI, ZH, FR, RU) with flag emoji. Back button to return to gender
- On language select: calls `PATCH /v1/users/me` (gender + language + auto-detected country), writes profile to RTDB `profiles/{userId}`, then navigates to home
- `onboardedAt` set server-side via `COALESCE(onboarded_at, NOW())` — idempotent

### App Shell

5-tab bottom navigation bar (accent `#FF8F00` amber):

| Index | Icon | Label | Badge |

- Top-left: status badge — `Live` (red `#FF3B30`) / `Busy` (orange `#FF9500`) / `Online` (green `#34C759`) / `Offline` (grey `#8E8E93`)
- Bottom-left: host display name + country flag + language
- Bottom-right: shake-animated call button

**Random match button:**
- Color: `#7BEA3B` (bright green), black text
- Tapping: checks coin balance, switches to Explore tab, starts a call session at 600 coins/min

---

### Tab 1 — Live

Centered screen with:
- Radial amber glow behind a flame-gradient circle icon (`live_tv_rounded`)
- Large "Go Live" heading
- Subtitle: "Start Live Stream and Connect"

## Audit Log

Quality grades (A+ to F) recorded after each feature audit. This is our history of quality.

### Live Streaming — 29 May 2026 — Overall: A+
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Architecture | A+ | Agora RTC + RTDB signaling, Cloud Function auto-ends on disconnect. Zero dead code — backend is pure REST (create/join/leave/end/gift/token), all real-time flows through RTDB directly. |
| Reconnection | A | `onConnectionStateChanged` with overlay, token refresh handler |
| Rate limiting | A | 500ms throttle on reactions/comments |
| Error handling | A | User-facing snackbars, graceful fallback |
| Resource cleanup | A | `_ending` guard prevents double-end, proper dispose |
| Code quality | A+ | ValueNotifier for comments, isolated state, no leaks, zero dead endpoints or unused dependencies |

### Messaging / Inbox — 29 May 2026 — Overall: A-
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Architecture | A | Firestore messages, RTDB presence, Cloud Function PG sync. Zero polling. |
| Presence | A | LRU cache (50 cap), canonical display statuses, live/premium/busy/away colors |
| Security | A | Block check both directions, anti-spam (5msg/10s + duplicate cooldown) |
| Calling | A- | Full signaling from thread, 30s timeout. Missing: rate preview in thread |
| Performance | A | No polling, debounced search, proper listener cleanup |
| Code quality | A | Dead code gone, clean modules, proper dispose |
| UX | A- | Search for new chat, live preview, inline translation, read receipts. Missing: typing indicator, message reactions |

### Call (Direct + Random) — 29 May 2026 — Overall: A
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Architecture | A+ | REST matchmaking + RTDB signaling + Agora RTC. Socket.IO fully purged from codebase (packages removed). Random inherits from Direct (shared DirectCallScreen). |
| Signaling | A | writeRinging → listen accept/decline → 30s timeout → Agora. Block check both directions. Cloud Function safety net on signal deletion. |
| Economy/Billing | A- | Tick every 15s, billing starts only when partner joins, insufficient balance auto-ends call |
| Reconnection | A | `onConnectionStateChanged` with overlay, `onTokenPrivilegeWillExpire` with renewal |
| Error handling | A | User-facing snackbars (balance, connection, Agora errors), graceful fallback, tick retries silently |
| Resource cleanup | A- | `_disposed` guard, engine release in dispose, timers cancelled. `_leaveWithResult` for random mode. |
| Security | A | Block check both directions, backend validates all billing, service key on internals |
| Code quality | A+ | Random = thin matchmaking layer inheriting DirectCallScreen. Zero duplication. Zero dead code. |

### IAP / Billing — 2 Jun 2026 — Overall: A+
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Architecture | A+ | Flutter `in_app_purchase` → backend verify-purchase → credit coins. StoreKit 2 + Google Play Billing. Direct credit endpoint blocked in production. |
| Apple verification | A+ | Full JWS certificate chain verified against Apple G3 root CA via `decodeTransaction()`. Forged receipts detected as `CertificateValidationError`. Validates bundleId + productId cryptographically. Rejects revoked transactions. |
| Google verification | A+ | Android now sends the Play purchase token, backend verifies `packageName + productId + token` with Android Publisher API, requires service-account credentials in production, and checks purchased/unconsumed state. |
| Refund handling | A+ | Apple ASNS V2 webhook + Google RTDN webhook. Google voided purchases now refund by purchase token, not order ID. `processRefund()` deducts coins immediately, records `iap_refund`, and is idempotent. |
| Idempotency | A+ | `iap_purchases.transaction_id` UNIQUE constraint. Check-before-insert prevents double-credit. Race conditions caught by PostgreSQL. |
| Retry safety | A+ | Store completion happens only after backend confirms credit. Android consumable coin packs are consumed after credit, so users can rebuy the same pack safely. Failed verifications retry on next app launch automatically. |
| Production hardening | A+ | `POST /v1/economy/purchase-coins` blocked unless `ALLOW_FAKE_PURCHASES=true`. Flutter fallback restricted to `kDebugMode`. |
| Code quality | A+ | Singleton `IapService.instance`. Clean separation: Flutter handles store interaction, backend handles all validation + crediting. Zero trust on client. |

### Onboarding — 2 Jun 2026 — Overall: A
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Architecture | A | Google + Apple login → `onboardedAt` null-check → profile setup or straight to home. Backend `COALESCE(onboarded_at, NOW())` on PATCH /me. No guest login. |
| Login flow | A | Google Sign-In + Apple Sign-In. Buttons disabled during loading. Proper error display. API offline warning on startup. |
| Profile setup | A | Nickname (2-20 chars, control chars blocked, emoji allowed), country picker, language dropdown. Keyboard dismiss on tap. Semantics labels. |
| Backend | A | `issueGoogleSession` / `issueAppleSession` → find-or-create user → JWT. `updateMe` sets `onboarded_at` via COALESCE on first profile save. Backfill migration for existing users. |
| Session restore | A | `main.dart` checks `profile.onboardedAt != null` — already-onboarded users skip setup on re-login. |
| Security | A | Google token verified server-side with audience check. Apple token verified via JWKS. No client-side trust. |
| Code quality | A | Clean separation: `onboarding_page.dart` (login), `profile_setup_screen.dart` (setup). No dead code. Proper dispose. |

### RTDB Architecture & Data Modeling — 3 Jun 2026 — Overall: A-
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Data model | A+ | 4 clean root nodes only: `presence`, `profiles`, `direct_calls`, `live_rooms`. Flat, predictable paths. |
| Normalization | A+ | Identity is centralized in `profiles/{userId}`. No broad denormalized name fan-out in persistent docs. |
| Presence robustness | A+ | `onDisconnect` + Cloud Function sync/reaper gives strong crash/offline recovery. |
| Client caching | A | LRU subscription cache (50 cap) for presence and profiles. RTDB remains source of truth. |
| Security rules | B- | `direct_calls` and `live_rooms/status` are too permissive; need stricter writer validation. |
| Indexing | C | Missing `.indexOn` for `comments.ts`, `reactions.ts`, `gifts.ts`; add indexes to avoid scans/warnings. |
| Scale posture | A- | Current approach is strong for MVP and early growth; scheduled global presence scan should evolve later at very high scale. |

### Full Solution Audit — 5 Jun 2026 — Overall: B-
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Product architecture | A- | Strong Flutter + NestJS + Postgres + Firebase RTDB/Firestore + Agora split. Clear source-of-truth intent and good MVP focus. |
| Hard-rule compliance | B | Source mostly avoids Socket.IO and centralizes RTDB in `FirebaseChatService.instance`; docs/comments still contain socket/polling drift, and API room heartbeat/cleanup uses periodic HTTP/timers. |
| Backend money safety | C | IAP and call/gift billing need real PostgreSQL transactions/idempotency. `IapService` uses `BEGIN`/`COMMIT` through pooled queries, so it is not a guaranteed transaction; call ticks can double-charge or lose session totals under retry/concurrency. |
| Random call flow | C | Backend matches live/online hosts, but only `RandomCallScreen` consumes `event: matched`. Hosts on Home/Live do not auto-join, so the core revenue flow can create sessions where the caller waits and the receiver never enters. |
| Firebase security | C+ | Firestore/Storage are reasonable for MVP, but RTDB `direct_calls`, `live_rooms/status`, and gift/comment/reaction writes are too permissive. UI events can be spoofed even when backend balances are safe. |
| IAP production readiness | C | Apple path is stronger, but Android passes purchase ID/order ID while backend treats it as Google purchase token; Google verification/refund correlation likely breaks in production. |
| Mobile architecture | B+ | Good singleton services, Agora screens, lifecycle cleanup, LRU presence/profile caches, and real-time UX. Needs stronger testability, random-match receiver handling, and fewer stale assumptions. |
| Test posture | C | Backend build passes and Functions build passes; backend unit tests, backend e2e, and Flutter widget tests currently fail due stale expectations/harnesses. No Postgres race/idempotency tests cover the highest-risk paths. |
| Documentation accuracy | C+ | `PRODUCT.md`, READMEs, tests, and instructions disagree on guest login, WebSocket/socket language, and some completion claims. Product direction is strong, but operating docs need cleanup. |

### RTDB Module Audit — 5 Jun 2026 — Overall: C+
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Module ownership | A- | RTDB client usage is mostly centralized in `FirebaseChatService.instance`, with backend Admin SDK writes limited to call signaling and cleanup. This matches the no-Socket.IO architecture. |
| Presence | B+ | `onDisconnect`, Cloud Function sync, and stale-presence reaper give good crash recovery. Needs stricter RTDB validation for allowed states/fields and stronger handling of live/busy/background transitions. |
| Direct-call signaling | C | `direct_calls/{userId}` is functionally simple, but any authenticated user can overwrite any user's signal node. Payload shape and caller/receiver ownership are not validated by rules. |
| Random-call signaling | C- | Backend writes `event: matched` to `direct_calls/{receiverId}`, but the Home listener only handles direct-call `status` values. Receivers outside `RandomCallScreen` may never join matched sessions. |
| Live-room realtime | C | Comments/reactions are acceptable MVP events, but room `status`, `audience_count`, and gifts are client-writable with weak validation. Gift UI can be spoofed even if backend economy is checked separately. |
| Counters/idempotency | C | Audience count uses client-side increments/decrements plus `onDisconnect`; duplicate joins, double dispose, or spoofed writes can produce inaccurate counts. Use per-viewer presence nodes or transactions for stronger counts. |
| Security rules | C- | Rules protect user-owned `presence` and `profiles`, but `direct_calls`, `live_rooms/status`, events, and counters are too broad. Add ownership constraints, field validation, enum checks, and `.indexOn` for timestamped event streams. |
| Scale posture | B- | Flat root nodes and LRU caches are good for MVP. Scheduled global presence scans and unbounded live event retention should evolve before larger scale. |

### Canonical Realtime Availability — 6 Jun 2026 — Overall: A
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Canonical RTDB cell | A | Mobile writes `schemaVersion`, `connection`, `activity`, `availability`, `routing`, `displayStatus`, `interruptible`, context IDs, timestamps, and legacy `state` only for compatibility. |
| Backend projection | A | Cloud Functions mirror canonical presence into Postgres fields for display, availability, routeability, and freshness. RTDB remains source of truth. |
| Direct-call routeability | A | Profile/chat UI and backend direct-call creation reject offline, busy, and premium-live receivers using canonical availability/routing. |
| Random-call routeability | A | Live-host and online fallback matchmaking require `presence_availability='available'` and `can_random_call=true`; away, busy, offline, and premium-live users are skipped. |
| Compatibility | A | Existing UI readers still work through legacy `state`, while new readers prefer `displayStatus`. This allows gradual module extraction without breaking current screens. |
| Remaining A+ gates | A- | RTDB emulator suite now passes locally (`pnpm test:rtdb:rules`, 6/6). Premium-live enter/exit transitions still need end-to-end implementation. |

### Direct Call Availability Hotfix — 6 Jun 2026 — Overall: A
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Error UX | A | Mobile parses backend error envelopes and maps direct-call failures to product messages instead of raw `API 400` transport text. |
| Presence projection | A | `onPresenceChanged` now uses RTDB written events, so first-time presence creates, updates, and deletes all mirror into Postgres availability. Deployed to Firebase project `zephyr-495115` on 6 Jun 2026. |
| Remaining risk | B+ | Manual two-account call retest is still required. Existing online users may need app foreground/login after deploy to rewrite their presence. |

### Random Call Receiver Lifecycle — 6 Jun 2026 — Overall: A
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Receiver entrance | A+ | `HomeScreen` now consumes backend `event=matched` from any app tab and shows a floating earning ribbon instead of requiring the receiver to already be inside `RandomCallScreen`. |
| Host UX | A | Ribbon shows caller name, host earning per minute, customer price per minute, accept, and decline. Host earning is derived from backend rate/share, not a hardcoded mobile claim. |
| Session cleanup | A | Accept removes the matched signal without triggering premature Cloud Function session end; decline, timeout, app pause, and partner-left events call backend random cleanup. |
| Shared call engine | A+ | Accepted random calls still enter `DirectCallScreen(mode=random)`, so Agora, billing, presence busy state, token renewal, and media controls stay reusable. |
| Matchmaking priority | A | Backend already favors available free-live hosts first, then available online hosts, while respecting block lists, busy sessions, routeability, and recent-match cooldown. |
| Rules coverage | A | RTDB emulator now covers random matched signal participant read/delete behavior. |
| Remaining A+ gate | A- | Needs manual two-account smoke on simulator/device before final A+ sign-off. Deeper telemetry-based host ranking can come after real usage data. |

### RTDB Module Ownership — 6 Jun 2026 — Overall: A
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Presence module | A+ | `PresenceRealtime` owns `presence/{userId}` payloads, onDisconnect, local LRU cache, foreground/background/live/call transitions, and display-status derivation. |
| Profile module | A+ | `ProfilesRealtime` owns `profiles/{userId}` writes, profile cache, and profile listener lifecycle. |
| Direct-call signals | A+ | `DirectCallSignals` owns `direct_calls/{userId}` ringing/status/remove/listen behavior. Rules restrict caller/receiver ownership, validate payload shape, and keep caller/session metadata immutable after creation. |
| Live-room realtime | A- | `LiveRoomRealtime` owns comments, reactions, gifts, audience count, status listen/end, and room initialization. Room nodes now include `hostUserId` for host-owned status writes. |
| Facade compatibility | A+ | `FirebaseChatService.instance` remains as the stable app-facing facade, forwarding to modules so existing screens do not churn. |
| Rules enforcement | A+ | RTDB rules validate canonical presence, profiles, direct-call signals, live-room host ownership, status enums, event shapes, reaction sender identity, gift shape limits, and direct-call metadata immutability. Emulator suite passes locally. |
| Remaining A+ gates | A- | Module ownership is now proven by executable rules tests. Product-level A+ still needs premium-live transition methods/rules and backend-confirmed trusted gift fan-out. |

### RTDB Rules Emulator Suite — 6 Jun 2026 — Overall: A+
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Test harness | A+ | Added repo-local `test:rtdb:rules` using Firebase Database emulator + `@firebase/rules-unit-testing`. |
| Coverage | A | Covers presence owner/schema, profile owner/shape, direct-call caller/receiver access, immutable call metadata, live-room host ownership, viewer comments/reactions, audience count validation, and gift payload bounds. |
| Execution | A+ | `pnpm test:rtdb:rules` passed 6 tests / 0 failures on 6 Jun 2026, including random matched signal participant read/delete coverage. |
| Tooling stability | A | Pinned repo-local `firebase-tools@14` so Java 17 works today. Future Firebase CLI v15+ requires Java 21, so plan that upgrade deliberately. |
| Remaining risk | B+ | Gift display fan-out is still client-written after backend charge success; move trusted fan-out to backend/Admin SDK before larger scale. |

### Backend Money Ledger — 6 Jun 2026 — Overall: A+
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Idempotency | A+ | Call ticks, call gifts, and live-room gifts now support `X-Idempotency-Key`/body keys. Duplicate retries replay the first stored response; reusing a key for different money details is rejected. |
| Call tick ledger | A+ | Database-backed call ticks run in one PostgreSQL transaction, lock the idempotency row, call session, and caller wallet with `FOR UPDATE`, check balance, update wallet/revenue/history/session totals together, and end insufficient-balance sessions inside the same transaction. |
| Call/live gifts | A+ | Direct/random call gifts and live-room gifts validate the active session/room, lock idempotency and spender wallet rows, check balance, update receiver revenue, and write spend/earning history in the same transaction. Live gifts use shared economy config instead of a hardcoded split. |
| IAP credit/refund | A | Purchase credit uses `DatabaseService.transaction`, inserts the unique purchase before wallet credit, and refund processing is transactional with a unique partial refund index. |
| Test coverage | A+ | Backend unit suite covers duplicate/reused idempotency keys, and `pnpm --filter zephyr-api test:db:race` passed 3/3 against local Postgres for duplicate concurrent ticks, low-balance concurrent ticks, and duplicate concurrent gifts. |
| Tooling | A | Added `test:db:race` and `DatabaseService.waitUntilReady()` so row-lock tests can run deliberately against local Postgres. Next step is wiring this into CI/default checks. |

### Full Solution Audit — 6 Jun 2026 — Overall: B
| Aspect | Grade | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Product architecture | B+ | The source-of-truth design is strong: Flutter + NestJS + Postgres + Firebase RTDB/Firestore + Agora is the right split for this app. The gap is execution completeness, not the big architecture choice. |
| Mobile entrances | B+ | Login, onboarding, feed, explore, inbox, direct call, random call, live, profile, wallet, and settings are present. Several entrances are still shallow or disconnected: feed call routing, profile follow, Explore caller identity, and premium live. |
| Realtime availability | A- | Canonical RTDB presence is a strong cell and backend matchmaking reads the projection. Product-level A+ is blocked by premium live transitions and manual two-account random/direct call smoke. |
| Backend economy | A | Paid call ticks and gifts now have transaction-safe row locks, idempotency replay, and real Postgres race tests. IAP credit/refund is transactional, and Android token verification contract is fixed. Remaining economy gap is backend-confirmed trusted gift fan-out. |
| IAP production readiness | A | Android code/backend contract now matches Google Play token verification and real app IDs, Render production env is set, and PR #5 promoted the backend path to `main`. Remaining sign-off: Google Play merchant/bank verification, one-time product catalog visibility, and one internal-test purchase/refund smoke. |
| Firebase ownership | A- | RTDB rules and module ownership improved a lot. Remaining trust gap is client-written gift/audience visual state and block/report split between Firestore and backend. |
| Premium live | C | Product model is documented, but implementation is not present yet: no paid-entry transition, host caps, per-minute premium-room billing, lock screen, or premium realtime module. |
| Test posture | B+ | Backend unit tests/build, Flutter analyze, RTDB emulator rules, and opt-in Postgres DB race tests pass. Flutter widget tests are stale, and RTDB/DB race suites still need CI/default check wiring. |
| Documentation accuracy | B- | `PRODUCT.md` is current after this audit, but OpenAPI and Copilot instructions still contain old guest/status assumptions and need cleanup. |
| A+ gates | Pending | Finish manual random/direct call smoke, Google Play internal-test IAP smoke, follow/host feed model, premium live lifecycle, stale tests/contracts, CI wiring, and backend-confirmed gift fan-out. |
